# Aspec - the tinkerer's pocket Alpha Particle Spectrometer!

I am currently a sophmore in high school and I really love particle physics. Unfortunately for me, there isn't a lot of hands-on particle physics activities you can do at home. Not anymore! I discovered some old schematics for an Alpha spectrometer from CERN OHL and I made some modifications to make Aspec!

Aspec interprets the signal from an Osram BPX61 photodiode and uses a hardwired preamplifier and high-pass filter circuit to give a signal to an oscilloscope through the signal holes! All you have to do is solder some jumper wires on, place it in a metal box where no light can get through to make sure there is no signal contamination on the photodiode, and plug everything in!

According to the guy who originally came up with this idea, a small sample of Americium-121 placed with the spectrometer in the metal box yields a pretty good analyzable result!
